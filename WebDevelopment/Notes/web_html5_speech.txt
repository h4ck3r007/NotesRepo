Read out the text
-------------------
To read out text create a new instance of SpeechSynthesisUtterance  and pass the text you want it to read and then call the method  window.speechSynthesis.speak with the instance of SpeechSynthesisUtterance.

Here is the code for same.

|	function speak(textToSpeak){													|
|		//Create a new instance of newSpeechSynthesisUtterance						|
|		var newSpeechSynthesisUtterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();			|
|		//Set the text to speak 													|
|		newSpeechSynthesisUtterance.text = textToSpeak;								|
|		//Speak now																	|
|		window.speechSynthesis.speak(newSpeechSynthesisUtterance);					|
|	} 																				|
