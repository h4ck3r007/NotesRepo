Techniques used for responsive design are

2. Flexible images : Sizes in relative units.
3. Media queries : Use CSS media queries


 JavaScript frameworks like Modernizr, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features

 Thankfully, the W3C created media queries as part of the CSS3 specification, improving upon the promise of media types.
 
 
 
 
Types of Layout
	There are different types of layout for the web page
		--> Fixed width layout	: When components of web page has fixed width irrespective of browser viewport size, it is called fixed width layout.
		--> Elastic layout : In fixed layout component width is mentioned in pixels but in elastic layout it is mentioned in ems instead of pixel. The em unit is multiple of the font size.
				Width in pixels / base font size = Width in em
			The width of components are relative so increase/decrease in font size restructure the components on page.
		--> Fluid layout : Fluid layouts are known as liquid layout or relative layouts. In this layout the width of components on web page are changed based on the browser viewport size to give best user experience.
