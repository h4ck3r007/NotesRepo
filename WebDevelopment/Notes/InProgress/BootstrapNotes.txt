Bootstrap
============

	Eric Meyer’s Reset CSS 
	
Bootstrap 2.0 uses Normalize.css, a project from Nicolas Gallagher that is part of the HTML5 Boilerplate.

if you don’t like the colors or want to change a default, this can be done by changing the globals in any of the .less files. To do this, update the scaffolding.less file or overwrite colors in your own stylesheet.

The default Bootstrap grid (see Figure 1-1) system utilizes 12 columns, making for a
940px-wide container without responsive features enabled. With the responsive CSS
file added, the grid adapts to be 724px or 1170px wide, depending on your viewport.
Below 767px viewports, such as the ones on tablets and smaller devices, the columns
become fluid and stack vertically. At the default width, each column is 60 pixels wide
and offset 20 pixels to the left.

To turn on the responsive features of Bootstrap, you need to add a <meta> tag to the
<head> of your web page
